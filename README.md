# FuelConsumption - Multiple Regression

This project demonstrates a Multiple Linear Regression analysis using the `FuelConsumption.csv` dataset. The regression model predicts the target variable based on a combination of multiple features.

## Features
- Preprocessing the data:
  - Selecting multiple features for the regression model.
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluation:
  - Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
- Results:
  - Printing model coefficients and evaluating the performance on test data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QueenAhllam/FuelConsumption-MultipleRegression.git
   cd FuelConsumption-MultipleRegression
